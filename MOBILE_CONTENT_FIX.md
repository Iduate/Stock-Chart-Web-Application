# Mobile Content Display Fix - Summary

## Problem
Content sections after the hero section were not displaying on mobile devices in the StockChart web application.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Hero section height issue**: The hero section was taking up 100vh (full viewport height), pushing other content below the fold
2. **CSS conflicts**: Multiple CSS files with conflicting mobile styles
3. **Z-index issues**: Hero background elements potentially covering content
4. **Missing mobile-specific CSS**: Lack of proper mobile content display rules

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CSS Fixes (`mobile-content-fix.css`)
- Reduced hero section height from 100vh to 70vh on mobile
- Added explicit display rules for all content sections
- Fixed container padding and overflow issues
- Ensured proper z-index stacking
- Added mobile-specific spacing and layout fixes

### 2. JavaScript Fixes (`mobile-content-fix.js`)
- Added content visibility enforcement on DOM load
- Fixed section display properties programmatically  
- Added debugging tools to identify invisible sections
- Implemented resize handling for orientation changes

### 3. HTML Improvements
- Added mobile-content-fix.css to the CSS includes
- Added mobile-content-fix.js to the script includes
- Improved viewport meta tag for better mobile behavior

## Files Modified
- `frontend/css/mobile-content-fix.css` (created)
- `frontend/js/mobile-content-fix.js` (created)  
- `frontend/home.html` (updated)

## Testing
To test the fixes on mobile:

1. Open Developer Tools in browser
2. Toggle device toolbar to simulate mobile
3. Refresh the page
4. Scroll down to verify all sections are visible
5. Check browser console for fix confirmation messages

## Debug Commands
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Manual fix trigger
fixMobileContentDisplay();

// Debug section visibility
document.querySelectorAll('section').forEach((s, i) => 
  console.log(`Section ${i}:`, s.className, getComputedStyle(s).display)
);
```

## Expected Results
- Hero section should be ~70% of viewport height on mobile
- All content sections (features, market data, CTA, footer) should be visible
- Content should not be cut off or hidden
- Page should scroll normally showing all sections
- Mobile users should see the complete site experience

## Viewport Breakpoints
- Mobile: ≤ 768px
- Small Mobile: ≤ 480px
- Desktop: > 768px
