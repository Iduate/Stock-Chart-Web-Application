# Mobile Optimization Update - Sept 9, 2025

This update addresses mobile display issues where charts and UI elements were being cut off on the right side of smartphone screens.

## Changes Made:

1. **Added mobile-fixes.css**:
   - Created a dedicated CSS file for mobile-specific fixes
   - Added proper overflow control to prevent horizontal scroll
   - Fixed chart container width issues on small screens
   - Improved responsiveness of grid layouts on mobile
   - Added mobile-specific adjustments for small screens (under 480px)

2. **Enhanced JavaScript for Chart Rendering**:
   - Updated `getMobileChartConfig()` to ensure charts fit within screen boundaries
   - Improved the chart resize handler to calculate safe dimensions
   - Added better support for very small screens
   - Fixed width calculation to prevent overflow

3. **Added Mobile CSS to All Pages**:
   - Added the mobile-fixes.css to all frontend HTML files
   - Updated the Django view to include mobile CSS in server-rendered pages

4. **Touch Interaction Improvements**:
   - Ensured charts support touch gestures properly
   - Improved touch scrolling behavior

## How to Test:

1. Test the site on multiple mobile devices with different screen sizes
2. Verify charts display correctly and don't overflow
3. Check that all UI elements are visible and not cut off
4. Test landscape and portrait orientations
5. Verify touch interactions work smoothly

## Next Steps (If Needed):

If additional mobile optimizations are required, consider:
- Further refinement of chart size and interactions for specific devices
- Additional testing on a broader range of devices
- Adding device-specific styles for problematic screen sizes
